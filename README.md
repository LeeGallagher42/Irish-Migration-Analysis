Irish Migration Analysis
Project Overview
This project explores migration trends in Ireland using data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) from 1987 to 2023. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modelling, and machine learning techniques to investigate emigration patterns over time.

Key Skills Demonstrated
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Statistical Modelling (Binomial, Poisson, Normal Distributions)
Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso)
Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
Model evaluation using R-squared, RMSE, and MAPE
Visual storytelling with Actual vs Predicted plots
Unsupervised learning with KMeans Clustering

Key Insights
Migration peaks and dips correspond with major economic and social events in Ireland’s history.
Regression models provided moderate predictive power but were limited by low variable correlation.
Clustering analysis revealed distinct migration-population groupings over time.

Future Improvements
Incorporate additional features like economic indicators, unemployment rates, or policy changes to improve predictive power.
Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit for real-time filtering and visualization.
